= DIRTPIES =

DIRTPIES is an homage to an old Atari ST game called "Mudpies". Move your
character around the screen. Pick up pies and fling them at the clowns. Don't
get hit by their juggling pins!

= CONTROLS =

Use arrow keys or WASD to move. Use the mouse to aim and click to fire.

= BUGS ABOUND =

There are bugs. Lots of bugs. Levels after 5 are not finished. Dirtslinger
mode is not active yet.
